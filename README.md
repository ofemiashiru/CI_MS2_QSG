## Scope

The scope of the project in itâ€™s first release is defined by the following features:

- Simple navigation that clearly shows the user what page they are currently on.  
- A footer on all pages that allows users to sign up to the mailing list and connect to social media platforms.
- A detailed section on the home page (index.html) that shows the pricing for subscribing to the websites services.
- Login and register links on all pages that display a modal to allow users to register or login.
- Artist (artists.html) and genre (genre.html) page that allows users to browse artists by letter or genre.
- Link to external YouTube site for each artists music, making sure that the page opens in a new tab/window. 
- Contact page with form to allow users to send queries. The form is functional and will not submit unless all fields are filled out.
- An error page (404.html) that directs users back to the previous page they were on if visiting a page that does not exist.
- An Events page (events.html) that allows users to see the latest events and navigate to their respective pages.
- A News page (news.html) that shows all the latest news.
- Google map embedded to display the location of the sites business office.
- Clear and simple favicon icon to help users identify the site.

Features to be built in future releases:

- In house music player, which is currently disabled, will be developed so that artist links will trigger the player instead of navigating to a YouTube link.
- Currently the comments form on each article navigates to a placeholder - this will be developed to display comments under each article.
- Search bar on navigation will be developed to help users quickly explore the catalogue of music on website.
- Develop login and register modals to store users details and subscription information in a database. This will also lead to a users account page being developed based on whether users are artists or fans.
- Mailing list form will successfully store visitors emails within a database for future alerts.

## Design

### Design Choices
QuickShot was designed to have an old school 80s game look that adopted some of the layout from 80s game displays creating a sense of nostalgia. The site is a simple scrolling page as it didn't need to be too complex and is simply made to advertise the game, display the leaderboard and give user the facility to send messages. The game design has a similar look to an old Nintendo game as I was looking to show how modern technology can still give users a sense of nostalgia while playing.

### Colour

For the colour scheme I opted for an army fatigue pallete of greens and browns to match the theme of the game.

![Colour Scheme](docs/features/colour-scheme.png)

### Fonts

The main headings of the site and game use Press Start 2P with a fallback of sans-serif to mimick the look of 80s games. This font is also used on the navigation. For the body text of the site I opted for the Oswald font which also has a fallback of sans-serif. Both fonts were imported using Google Fonts API.

### Structure
The website is structured to mimick the style of high end magazines with a simple top down, left to right flow of information. It is user friendly and has recognisable elements such as a fixed navigation bar along the top that consists of the business brand logo, menu for each page, search bar and login & register buttons. Each page is responsive in nature and has been tested on the industry standard width of 320px.

The website consists of 6 main pages:
- Home page which shows what the site is about, featured albums, and the various subscription options
- Artist page which allows users to browse the artist they want to listen to by letter and shows the top three featured artists
- Genre page which allows users to browse the artist they want to listen to by genre
- Events page which allows users to see the latest events and navigate to their corresponding sites
- News page which allows users to see and keep up with the latest news
- Contact page which allows users to contact the business and locate the office
