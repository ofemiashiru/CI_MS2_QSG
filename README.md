## Scope

The scope of the project in itâ€™s first release is defined by the following features:

- Simple navigation that allows user to navigate between sections of the site and the game. 
- Game page that allows user to play game, see how to play game, save score to the leaderboard and navigate back to main site.
- Allow user to see their score on the leaderboard if they have reached the top ten.
- Allow users to see the top ten players on the leaderboard.
- Contact form to allow users to send queries. The form is fully functional using EmailJS and will not submit unless all fields are filled out.
- An error page (404.html) that appears when visiting a page that does not exist with navigation above.
- Clear and simple favicon icon to help users identify the site.

Features to be built in future releases:

- Addition of social media links when QuickShot develop their social media platforms.
- Active links to Apples App store and Google Plays store when the game becomes available on these platforms.

## Design

### Design Choices
QuickShot was designed to have an old school 80s game look that adopted some of the layout from 80s game displays creating a sense of nostalgia. The site is a simple scrolling page as it didn't need to be too complex and is simply made to advertise the game, display the leaderboard and give user the facility to send messages. The game design has a similar look to an old Nintendo game as I was looking to show how modern technology can still give users a sense of nostalgia while playing.

### Colour

For the colour scheme I opted for an army fatigue palete of greens and browns to match the theme of the game.

![Colour Scheme](docs/features/colour-scheme.png)

### Fonts

The main headings of the site and game use Press Start 2P with a fallback of sans-serif to mimick the look of 80s games. This font is also used on the navigation. For the body text of the site I opted for the Oswald font which also has a fallback of sans-serif. Both fonts were imported using Google Fonts API.

### Structure
The main site is structured with different sections for each page . Both main site and game are responsive in nature and have been tested on the industry standard width of 320px.

The website consists of 6 main pages:
- Home page which shows what the site is about, featured albums, and the various subscription options
- Artist page which allows users to browse the artist they want to listen to by letter and shows the top three featured artists
- Genre page which allows users to browse the artist they want to listen to by genre
- Events page which allows users to see the latest events and navigate to their corresponding sites
- News page which allows users to see and keep up with the latest news
- Contact page which allows users to contact the business and locate the office
